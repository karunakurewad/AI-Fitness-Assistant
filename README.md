    !pip install -q google-generativeai
    ```

2. **Upload Background Image**
    ```python
    from google.colab import files
    uploaded = files.upload()  # Upload your fitness.jpg image
    ```

3. **Create `backend.py`**
    - Contains:
      - Google Gemini API configuration
      - `get_fitness_advice()` function for AI interaction
      - `save_user_data()` function to log user details

4. **Create `app.py`**
    - Streamlit app with:
      - User input forms
      - AI fitness advice display
      - Background image setup

5. **Setup Ngrok**
    ```python
    from pyngrok import ngrok
    from google.colab import userdata

    ngrok.kill()  # Kill old tunnels
    auth_token = userdata.get('nagrok')  # Fetch your stored ngrok token
    ngrok.set_auth_token(auth_token)
    public_url = ngrok.connect(8501).public_url
    print(f"🚀 Public URL: {public_url}")
    ```

6. **Run the Streamlit App**

## ⚡ How it Works
- User provides details like Name, Age, Weight, Height, Gender, Activity Level, and Fitness Goal.
- App sends this data to **Google Gemini AI**.
- Gemini generates a personalized:
  - Diet Plan
  - Exercise Plan
  - Ideal Weight Suggestions
  - Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Output is beautifully displayed on the page and user data is saved.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- 🔑 Set your **Google Gemini API Key** directly inside `backend.py`.
- 🖼️ Make sure the background image file (`fitness.jpg`) is uploaded properly.
- 🔗 Ensure Ngrok Auth Token is stored securely (for `userdata.get()` to work).
- 🧹 Always **kill previous ngrok tunnels** before creating a new one.
